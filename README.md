# Blood Cell Detection with YOLOv10 and Ultralytics
This repository contains a YOLOv10-based object detection model trained with the Blood Cell Detection dataset using the Ultralytics framework. The dataset consists of 364 images and 4888 labeled instances across three main classes:

* WBC (White Blood Cells)
* RBC (Red Blood Cells)
* Platelets
  
The model is designed to detect and classify blood cells in microscopic images, an important task in medical diagnostics.
